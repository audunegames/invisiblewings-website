          <p>We've launched our public Discord server, <a href="https://discord.gg/2bbEpTkPDG">Mae's Place</a>! According to our own Dawn, Mae's Place has been there as long as she remembers, and she hopes it wil never go away as well! Feel welcome to join us to chit chat, talk about Invisible Wings, share cool stuff, and other fun things!</p>
          <p>But that's not all! We also launched our <a href="https://patreon.com/audune">Patreon</a> page to help fund the development of the full version of Invisible Wings! The demo for Invisible Wings will be released on Steam and Itch.io on April 15th, which is a proof of concept for the narrative and world building, and provides a vertical slice of the story in the form of an interactive visual novel. From there, we want to make a narrative adventure game, featuring Dawn's whole story, modeled in beautiful 3D environments full of things to explore, akin to Dreamfall and Life Is Strange. With your support, which can be as low as € 1 per month, you can help us making the full game a reality! Pledging € 5 or more also gives you a sneak peek in the development process and access to the patron lounge on Discord.</p>
          <p>We hope to see you soon on our Discord server or Patreon!</p>

          <h3 class="has-text-primary-dark">Demo release on April 15th, 2021</h3>

          <p>On April 15th the demo of Invisible Wings will be released as an interactive visual novel. This demo features a fully polished vertical slice of Dawn's story, which can be played in roughly 45 minutes, and acts like a proof of concept for the world and the complete story.</p>
          <p>After this release, we will look into funding and start a crowdfunding campaign in order to turn Invisible Wings into a fully-fledged narrative adventure game. With your help the rest of the story can be realized, and you can continue this adventure together with Dawn, Lilith and Aranea! We're not going to spoil anything, but there are still a lot of surprises waiting for them!</p>

            <span>&ldquo;A visual novel in which fairies pose a threat? Very nice idea and I really like the world building around it. Has a good serious undertone in many scenes, which reflects society and its difficulties well. [...] the structure that was built around it is more than solid and already makes you curious about the finished game.&rdquo;</span><br>

        <h3 class="has-text-centered">Dawn</h3>
        <p>Dawn is a young female hybrid with one great wish: to be just an ordinary human. For years she has constantly been confronted with her appearance and heritage, even although she looks more human than other hybrids. She blames the faerie species for being an outcast in the human-dominated world and desperately tries to seek answers to her identity, but with little luck so far. It also doesn’t help that racism even went so far to not letting faeries and hybrids participate in official sport events, which clashes with Dawn’s great passion for figure skating. However, these issues only seem the beginning of Dawn’s journey...</p>

        </figure>

        <h3 class="has-text-centered">Lilith</h3>
        <p>Being a faerie seems to be quite hard in a world dominated by human beliefs, especially for a social butterfly like Lilith. Few know however that she tries to cope with a past experience that forced her to leave her faerie tribe, giving her a dreamy, restless and sometimes impulsive personality. She tries to disguise this mental scar by being nice to everyone, but not always with success. Luckily Lilith has the advantage of possessing magic to hide her wings and tail from plain sight, something that also proves to be useful to enter the figure skating competition.</p>

        </figure>

        <h3 class="has-text-centered">Aranea</h3>
        <p>Strongly led by her own ideals, Aranea is an ambitious hybrid who fights for equal rights for hybrids and a halt to the racism they undergo. She feels however a great resentment towards faeries, because in her opinion they took away a blissful future for her own species. Aranea is Dawn's best friend since their childhood and gives her a lot of support, but her own ideals seem conflicting with Dawn’s personal wish and maybe even with common moral sense...</p>
